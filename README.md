# Solar Knights BCA's Solar Car Competition Team
The Solar Car created by the Bergen County Academies Solar Knights

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and the BCA Solar Knights <br />
Advisor: Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) & Mr. Ee (William Ee's Father) & Mr. Victor Samarkone (BCA) <br />
Context: The Solar Car Challenge in Texas <br />
Projekt Name: Solar Knight's Solar Car <br />
Start Date: September 30, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This project was made in joint with the Solar Knights, the Bergen County Academies' Competitive Solar Car Team. This was done to compete in the Solar Car Challenge, one of the largest solar car competitions in the US, taking place in Texas. This is a student-led group with adult and teacher advisors. My job was mainly focused on electronics, specifically the lowe power systems, especially the custom battery pack. I would later on lead the framework design team and become the regulation manager. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
